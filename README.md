# docta

docta is a simple health checker service. It aims to provide checks that you
probably need (HTTP, file, CPU, memory, etc.) out-of-the-box, and produce output
compatible with existing monitoring solutions with meaningful information.

It is lightweight, and designed to sit on the same host as your application as a
health check endpoint.
